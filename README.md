# Computer Organization and Assembly Language (EE229)

## Course Overview
This course focuses on teaching lower-level programming, particularly machine and assembly language, and their application in typical computer systems. It specifically covers **assembly language for x86 processors**, compatible with Intel and AMD processors on both **32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems**. The goal is to provide students with an understanding of **computer architecture** and how the operating system interacts with hardware.

## Textbook Information
- **Main Textbook**: *Assembly Language for x86 Processors (7th Edition)* by Kip Irvine
- **Reference Book**: *Computer Organization and Architecture (10th Edition)* by William Stallings

## Course Content

### **Weeks 1 - 4**: Introduction to Computer Organization and Assembly Language Fundamentals
- **Topics**: Binary representation, x86 processor architecture, data types, boolean expressions, program structure, data transfer instructions, arithmetic operations.

### **Weeks 5 - 8**: Advanced Assembly Language Techniques and Procedures
- **Topics**: Procedures, stack operations, calling conventions, recursion, multi-module programs, advanced parameter passing, 64-bit programming.

### **Weeks 9 - 11**: Conditional Processing, Integer Arithmetic, and Arrays
- **Topics**: Conditional jumps, loops, arithmetic shifts, string processing, array manipulation, sorting algorithms.

### **Weeks 12 - 13**: Structures, Macros, and File Handling
- **Topics**: Structs, unions, macros, file handling in assembly language.

## Course Activities
- **Lectures**: In-class lectures with multimedia support.
- **Exercises**: Practical assignments and hands-on programming tasks.
- **Labs**: Weekly lab sessions focusing on assembly language implementation.
- **Assignments**: Individual and group work to reinforce lecture concepts.
- **Group Presentations**: Presentations on selected topics to develop communication skills.
- **Semester Project**: Development of an assembly language program as a final project.

## Assessment Structure
- **Quizzes and Assignments**: Regular assessments to track understanding.
- **Midterm and Final Exams**: Comprehensive exams covering both theoretical and practical aspects.
- **Project**: A final project that applies the concepts learned throughout the course.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will:
- Gain a deep understanding of **computer organization** and **architecture**.
- Be proficient in **assembly language programming**, particularly for **x86 processors**.
- Develop the ability to write efficient code that interacts directly with hardware components.

## Lab Work
Attendance in lab sessions is mandatory to practice assembly language programming and apply real-world assembly language applications.
